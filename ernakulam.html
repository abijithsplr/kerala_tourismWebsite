          <br>
          <ol>
            <li> <b>Bolghatty Island.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/ernakulam/1489222784_bolgaty-island.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"><br>

            <br>
            <p>The Bolgatty Island, is a historic town, in the commercial capital of Fort Kochi in Ernakulam. The main
              attraction here is the palace of the same name. This island is easily
              accessible from the mainland. India’s one and only international marina, the Kochi International Marina,
              is another important part of this island.
            </p>

            <br>
            <li> <b>Bolghatty Palace.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/ernakulam/1489222806_Bolgatty_Palace.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"><br>

            <br>
            <p>In the island of Bolgatty lies Kochi’s famous Bolgatty Palace. It is one of the oldest existing Dutch
              palaces in the world. It was built by the Dutch traders in the year 1744 and later was extended and
              gardens were landscaped around it.

              This was at that time the Governor’s palace for the commander of the Dutch Malabar. In the year 1909 it
              was leased out to the British, hence serving as the home of the British Governors. It was also the seat of
              the British Resident of Cochin during the British Raj.

              Later on in the year 1947, when India attained independence from the British, the palace became the
              state’s property and then later was converted into a heritage hotel resort. Now this palace has a swimming
              pool along with a 9 hole golf course and an ayurvedic centre.</p>

            <br>
            <li> <b>Cherai Beach.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/ernakulam/1489222823_cherai.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"><br>

            <br>
            <p>Bordering the Vypeen island off Cochin is the lovely beach of Cherai. It is located about 25 kilometers
              away from Kochi and about 30 kilometers from Kochi International
              Airport at Nedumbassery.

              This beach is a popular tourist destination especially among the foreigners. The beach is less busy and
              cleaner as compared to many other beaches in Ernakulam district. Cherai beach is lined with Chinese
              fishing nets, coconut groves and paddy fields offering the perfect setting.

            <li> <b> Fort Kochi.</b></li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>Get nostalgic and get back to the olden days at Fort Kochi, the commercial capital of Kerala. Fort
              Immanuel Thakur House David Hall Parade Ground, Bastion Bungalow Vasco Da Gama square Pierce Leslie
              Bungalow, Bishop's house etc are some of the major attractions of this place. Fort Kochi is one of the
              places in Kerala where you can get to see a diverse range of cultures. From Malayalis to Jews to Dutch,
              you can find traces of their culture here.

              The major highlight of this place is the Chinese Fishing nets, which can be seen, lined in the coastline.
              In all at Fort Kochi you can get to see modernity mixed with tradition. There is no other better option
              than to set off exploring on foot, for the true experience of Fort Kochi. To reach there one can take a
              bus or Ferry from the mainland of Ernakulam.

            <li> <b>Dutch Cemetery.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/ernakulam/1489222912_dutch-cemetery.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"><br>

            <br>
            <p>Forming an evidence of Kochi’s connection with the Dutch is the Dutch cemetery at Fort Kochi. It was
              sanctified in the year 1724 and till date contains almost 104 epitaphs and tombs, containing authentic
              details of the Dutch and British people buried there. Seeing all this, visitors who come here are reminded
              of the foreigners who came to Kochi so as to expand their empires.

              The St. Francis Church maintains the record of those who were buried here and the Church of South India
              (CSI) is who manages the cemetery. The tombs at this place are made out of granite and red laterite stones
              but do not have a cross. The inscriptions in each of the epitaph are in the Old Dutch script. No longer
              used, the last person to be buried here, according to the author TW Venn, was Captain Joseph Ethelbert
              Winckler, in the year 1913.
