          <br>
          <p>Kollam is a city in the state of Kerala, on India's Malabar Coast. It’s known as a
            trade hub and for its beaches, like lively Kollam and secluded Thirumullavaram. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
            Police Museum has artifacts tracing the history of the police force. Nearby, Ashtamudi Lake is a gateway
            to the Kerala backwaters, a network of waterways rich with vegetation. The striped 1902 Tangasseri
            Lighthouse has ocean views.
            <br>

            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/Jatayu’s-Earth-Centre-kollam-kb6592 (1).jpg" alt=""><br>

            <br>
            <p>A huge rock at Chadayamangalam takes its name from the mythical bird `Jatayu in the epic Ramayana, who is
              believed to have collapsed on the rock after failing in his attempts to thwart Ravanas kidnapping of Sita.

              Recently the Jatayu Earth Centre, a rock theme park was opened here. This includes the world’s large bird
              sculpture of Jatayu, a museum and a multi dimensional theatre. Other than this they also offer activities
              like archery, rappelling, rock and ladder climbing and so on.</p>

            <br>
            <li> <b> Lighthouse.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/kollam/1474346776_light-house.jpg" alt=""><br>

            <br>
            <p> The Dutch Quilon as it was called, used to be a British Enclave. The place is also popular as
              Thangasseri. The lighthouse built at Quilon by the British in the year 1902 is visible as far as 13 miles
              in the sea. The lighthouse stands to an amazing height of 144 feet and is the second tallest lighthouse as
              well as one of the most visited lighthouses of Kerala.

              The picturesque view of the sea from the place where the lighthouse stands is breathtaking. In the
              vicinity lies the Portuguese Fort. The fort was built in the year 1517 and at present only a wall of the
              fort has escaped the assaults made by Time.</p>

            <li> <b>Ashtamudi Lake.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/kollam/1474346861_Ashtamudi Lake.jpg" alt=""><br>

            <br>
            <p>The serene Ashtamudi Lake is a great place to hanker for in the Kollam district. It is the most visited
              backwater and lake of Kerala. Ashtamudi means ‘Eight Coned’ in Malayalam. This lake or Kayal is lined with
              palm and coconut trees.

              The house boat trips here are great pleasures and so is the boat cruise. The boat cruise to Munroe Islands
              is a wonderful experience. The popular cruises one can avail at the place are Kayal Pradakshina Cruise and
              Sayanthanam Sunset Cruise.

            <li> <b> Punalur Suspension Bridge.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/kollam/522px-PUNALUR_SUSPENSION_BRIDGE.jpg" alt=""><br>

            <br>
            <p>The Punalur Suspension Bridge is the first motorable bridge in South India. The suspension bridge
              crossing the river is the only suspended-deck type in south India. Built in 1877 by Albert Henry across
              the Kallada River, this huge bridge was suspended by two spans and was used for vehicular movement.
              Construction took more than six years. It is said that after completion of the bridge people hesitated to
              walk over the bridge. In order to prove the strength of the bridge the engineer and his family passed
              under the bridge in a country boat while six elephants were walking over it. Now the bridge is of
              historical interest and is a major tourist attraction.
