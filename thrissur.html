          <h1> <u> Thrissur </u></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Thrissur is a city in the south Indian state of Kerala. It's known for sacred sites and
            colorful festivals. In the center is Vadakkumnathan Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva and adorned with
            murals. The ornate, Indo-Gothic Our Lady of Dolours Basilica is nearby. To the north, Thiruvambady Temple
            is home to several elephants. Sakthan Thampuran Palace houses an archaeology museum with bronze statues
            and ancient coins.

            <br>
            <p>An ancient temple of Kerala, the Vadakkunnathan Temple is also the oldest temple of the state dedicated
              to Lord Shiva. Following the architectural style of Kerala, the temple has monumental towers surrounding
              it.

              Talking about the inside of the temple, there are several mural paintings that depict various episodes
              from the Hindu Epic, Mahabharata.

              Thekkinkadu Maidan, which surrounds the temple from all sides is where the local festival of Thrissur
              Pooram is organized every year, granting this place an even more of spiritual importance.

            <li> <b>Shakthan Thampuran Palace.</b></li>

            <br>
            <p>Built after a rather Dutch style architecture, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace is a sight to behold.
              Finding its name in almost every list of Thrissur tourist places, the Shakthan Thampuran Palace was
              rebuilt in the place of Vadakkekara Palace in the year 1795 by the then King Ramavarma Thampuram of
              Cochin.

              In the year 2005, the palace was converted into a museum that now showcases a number of relics and really
              old antiques. A favourite one amongst several art admirers, the two-storeyed complex has high roofs,
              thicker than usual walls, and Italian Marble on the floor, making it a place right out of a travellerâ€™s
              dream.</p>

            <li> <b>Athirappilly Waterfalls.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/thrissur/1550744668_1200px-Athirapally_Water_falls.jpg..webp" alt=""><br>

            <br>
            <p>On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the
              best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest
              in the state of Kerala.

              The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River,
              that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group
              outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India

            </p>

            <br>
            <li> <b> Dolours Basilica.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/thrissur/1550745772_2019-02-21.png..webp" alt=""><br>

            <br>
            <p>The Dolours Basilica, or the Basilica of Our Lady of Dolours (as the full name goes), is a distinct
              building in the city of Thrissur. You can easily recognize this grand church from its white facade.

              Smack in the middle of a lush green valley, this basilica is known for narrating quite a number of stories
              of love and faith. Spread in an area of about 25,000 sq feet, Dolours Basilica is the third tallest church
              in Asia and the largest church in the country with double storeyed aisles.

            <li> <b>Kerala Kalamandalam.</b></li>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/District/thrissur/1551339006_Koothambalam_at_Kerala_Kalamandalam.jpg" alt=""><br>

            <br>
            <p>A University of Art and Culture, Kerala Kalamandir is a Government of India recognized institution
              dedicated to providing learning in the many performing arts native to India. Their main focus has always
              been on the arts that have been developed in Southern India.

              The Kerala Kalamandalam was what gave three main arts of Kerala a new life, namely Kathakali, Kudiyattam,
              and Mohiniyattam. For the sake of performing arts, and if you are someone who is a fanatic for them, this
              is definitely the place to be. The best part is that the institute is housed on the banks of the
              Bharathapuzha River.
