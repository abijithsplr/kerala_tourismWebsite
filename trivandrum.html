            <p>The splendid palace is situated at Thuckalai, on the way to Kanyakumari which once the seat of the
              erstwhile rulers of Travancore. This is a well preserved wooden palace, a glorious testimony to the
              traditional Kerala School of architecture. The extraordinary murals, exquisite floral carvings and the
              black glossy granite floor have withstood the test of time.

            <p>Varkala is a land of seaside resort and spa. It is also an important Hindu centre of pilgrimage. The
              final resting place of the great social reformer, Sree Narayana Guru, is near Varkala, atop a hill called
              Sivagiri. High cliffs with mineral springs rise majestically from the coastline. According to a myth, sage
              Narada was approached by a group of mendicants who confessed to having sinned. Narada threw his
              valkkalam(cloth made of the bark of a tree) into the air, and the place where it landed was subsequently
              named Varkala. The mendicants were directed by Narada to offer their prayers in the newly created place by
              the seashore. The place where they prayed for redemption, came to be known as the Papanasham Beach (
              Papanasham means redemption from sins). The 2000 year old Sree Janardhana Swamy Temple and the Nature Care
              Centre are the two main attractions here.
